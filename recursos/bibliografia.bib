	ABSTRACT = {Traffic operation efficiency is greatly impacted by the increase in travel demand and the increase in vehicle ownership. The continued increase in traffic demand has rendered the importance of controlling traffic, especially at intersections. In general, the inefficiency of traffic scheduling leads to traffic congestion, resulting in a rise in fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, and poor quality of service. Various methods for time series forecasting have been proposed for adaptive and remote traffic control. The prediction of traffic has attracted profound attention for improving the reliability and efficiency of traffic flow scheduling while reducing congestion. Therefore, in this work, we studied the problem of the current traffic situation at Muhima Junction one of the busiest junctions in Kigali city. Future traffic rates were forecasted by employing long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, respectively. Both the models’ performance criteria for adequacy were the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results revealed that LSTM is the best-fitting model for monthly traffic flow prediction. Within this analysis, we proposed an adaptive traffic flow prediction that builds on the features of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication and the Internet of Things (IoT) to control traffic while enhancing the quality of service at the junctions. The real-time actuation of traffic-responsive signal control can be assured when real-time traffic-based signal actuation is reliable.},

The data driven approach using Box-Jenkins Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models reported in most studies demands sound database for model building. Hence, the applicability of these models remains a question in places where the data availability could be an issue. The present study tries to overcome the above issue by proposing a prediction scheme using Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model for short term prediction of traffic flow using only limited input data.},

	abstract = {Accurate traffic flow prediction is important for congestion identification and traffic dispersion. The original traffic flow data may generate different noises in the detector collection process and data aggregation process, resulting in large errors in the prediction results. To solve the problems above, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network model based on wavelet reconstruction (WT-2DCNN), which eliminates potential outliers in the data by introducing wavelet method, and constructs a WT-2DCNN model based on data extension and fusion of convolutional neural networks, and obtains the internal trend features of traffic flow through multiple convolutional and pooling layers in this model for traffic flow prediction. In this paper, the performance and training efficiency of the WT-2DCNN model has been validated on the publicly available Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) dataset, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are significantly lower than those of other algorithms, and the training time is only 1/4 to 1/3 of that of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), indicating that the WT-2DCNN model has higher accuracy and more efficient training efficiency.}
